------------------------
Creating Python code to support the technical writing and documentation process for an AI-based employee training tool involves automating several aspects of content generation, document management, and test case generation. Below is an approach for automating some of the key tasks to make the documentation process smoother for the writer. This would cover:

    Extracting Product and Architecture Details from an existing codebase or application (e.g., using reflection and introspection to generate docs from code).
    Documenting APIs: Generate documentation for any RESTful or GraphQL APIs used by the application.
    Creating a Knowledge Base: This could involve generating markdown or HTML files, depending on your platform, which can be directly used in the knowledge base.
    Automating Test Case Generation: Generating or assisting in test cases for documentation purposes.

Let’s break it down step-by-step.
1. Automating Documentation Generation from Code (Extracting Architecture and API Docs)

You can extract high-level details about the application using Python's inspect module and reflection to generate an architecture overview. Here's an example for generating documentation on Python classes and methods:
Example Python code to automatically document classes and functions:

import inspect
import json
from datetime import datetime

# Assuming you have an AI-based training tool's Python code with classes and functions
# Let's create a function that auto-generates documentation from the codebase

def generate_class_docs(cls):
    """
    Generates documentation for the class and its methods
    """
    docs = {
        "class_name": cls.__name__,
        "docstring": cls.__doc__,
        "methods": []
    }
    
    # Get all methods of the class
    for method_name, method in inspect.getmembers(cls, predicate=inspect.isfunction):
        method_doc = {
            "method_name": method_name,
            "docstring": method.__doc__,
            "signature": str(inspect.signature(method))
        }
        docs["methods"].append(method_doc)
    
    return docs

def generate_module_docs(module):
    """
    Generates documentation for the entire module including all classes and methods
    """
    module_docs = {
        "module_name": module.__name__,
        "docstring": module.__doc__,
        "classes": []
    }
    
    # Iterate over all classes in the module
    for name, obj in inspect.getmembers(module, inspect.isclass):
        class_docs = generate_class_docs(obj)
        module_docs["classes"].append(class_docs)
    
    return module_docs

# Example usage: generate documentation from your Python module
import your_ai_module  # Import the module you want to document
docs = generate_module_docs(your_ai_module)

# Save docs to a JSON file
with open(f"docs_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')}.json", 'w') as outfile:
    json.dump(docs, outfile, indent=4)

This script will automatically document all the classes and methods in your Python code, providing the method signatures and docstrings for each function. You can export this to JSON or Markdown for use in your knowledge base.
2. Generating API Documentation (Swagger)

If your application has RESTful APIs, you can generate automatic documentation for the APIs using Python libraries like Flask-RESTPlus or FastAPI for generating Swagger UI.
Example with FastAPI:

pip install fastapi uvicorn

from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Define the application
app = FastAPI()

# Define a Pydantic model for the input data
class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str = None
    price: float
    tax: float = None

# Define an API endpoint
@app.post("/items/")
async def create_item(item: Item):
    return {"name": item.name, "price": item.price}

# Run the app with: uvicorn <filename>:app --reload

With this setup, FastAPI automatically generates Swagger UI documentation, accessible via /docs on the running server. This makes it easy to get accurate API documentation and integrate it into the knowledge base.
3. Documenting User Journeys (Interactive Flow Diagrams)

You can document user journeys by leveraging diagramming tools that generate visual representations of flows. If you prefer to generate such flow diagrams programmatically, you can use tools like Graphviz or PyGraph.
Example: Using Graphviz to visualize user journey:

pip install graphviz

from graphviz import Digraph

def generate_user_journey():
    dot = Digraph(comment='User Journey')

    # Add nodes (steps in the user journey)
    dot.node('A', 'User Logs In')
    dot.node('B', 'User Navigates to Training Dashboard')
    dot.node('C', 'User Starts Training')
    dot.node('D', 'User Completes Training')

    # Add edges (transitions between steps)
    dot.edge('A', 'B', 'Login Successful')
    dot.edge('B', 'C', 'Training Dashboard')
    dot.edge('C', 'D', 'Training Completed')

    # Output file (image)
    dot.render('user_journey', view=True)

generate_user_journey()

This will generate a .pdf or .png that illustrates the user journey, which you can add to your knowledge base or internal documentation.
4. Writing Knowledge Base Articles and Training Scripts

You can use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to assist in generating simple knowledge base articles. If your app has specific user interactions or features, you could write a simple script that generates basic articles.

Here’s an example of generating a simple FAQ for common user questions:

import random

def generate_faq():
    questions = [
        "How do I log in?",
        "How do I start training?",
        "How can I track my progress?"
    ]
    answers = [
        "To log in, enter your username and password on the login screen.",
        "To start training, navigate to the 'Training' tab and select your course.",
        "Your progress can be tracked from the 'Dashboard' where you can view completed modules and certifications."
    ]
    
    faq = {}
    for q, a in zip(questions, answers):
        faq[q] = a
    
    return faq

# Save as markdown
faq = generate_faq()
with open("faq.md", 'w') as file:
    for q, a in faq.items():
        file.write(f"### {q}\n\n{a}\n\n")

This code will generate simple FAQ entries in markdown format, which you can directly upload to your knowledge base.
5. Test Case Generation for QA Testing

If your product has automated tests, you can use unittest or pytest to generate test cases and include them in your documentation.
Example: Generating and Running Unit Tests

import unittest

class TestAIModel(unittest.TestCase):
    
    def test_predict_training(self):
        # Example test case to check AI model predictions
        model = AIModel()
        result = model.predict('sample data')
        self.assertEqual(result, 'expected result')
    
    def test_model_accuracy(self):
        # Test model's accuracy
        model = AIModel()
        accuracy = model.evaluate()
        self.assertGreater(accuracy, 0.95)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

The test results can be captured and included in documentation for easy understanding of how tests are run.
6. Project Management

As a technical writer with project management experience, you may want to track the progress of your documentation and testing. You can use tools like Jira, Trello, or GitHub issues to manage tasks effectively.
Conclusion

The above Python scripts automate much of the work involved in technical documentation and testing. They include:

    Automatic code and API documentation generation.
    Visual user journey mapping.
    Knowledge base article and training script generation.
    QA testing and automated test case generation.

These tools would save time and help ensure your documentation is always up-to-date and aligned with the development process.
